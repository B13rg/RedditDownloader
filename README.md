# Reddit Downloader
Downloads all Liked/Saved posts &amp; comments from your Reddit account. Will also attempt to parse links contained within comments or self-post text.

Will not download duplicates of the same file, and will automatically scan to and resume where it last left off.

Requires that you register an app at [Reddit's App Page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) to get access to view Posts through the Reddit API.

On first launch, it will generate a *settings.json* file, where you can enter your data.

**Assuming everything's up to date, these are the currently supported sources for Submissions/Comments.**

*Note that it is possible to have more than one of the same type of source.*

*Sources are given an alias when you set them up, and - if you desire - this alias can be embedded into 
the final file output paths [(See "Output Format" Arguments)](../Arguments.md) to further differentiate 
the various sources.*

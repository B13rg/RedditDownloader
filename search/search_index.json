I appreciate any help I can get, and I'm always open to suggestions. I'll make sure any contributors get credit for their work on each release cycle. That said; There are a few things to keep in mind in order to make the process run smoothly for everybody: 1. If you're fixing a bug or adding something new, let us know. \u00b6 If repairing a bug, please leave a message on the bug's report informing everyone it's being worked on. Make sure you check first to see if anybody else has already submitted a fix. If you're adding something new or changing existing systems, either open an Issue or message shadowmoose about it. This is simply to avoid doubling effort and wasting time. 2. ShadowMoose going to have to review everything submitted. \u00b6 Obviously, I'm going to have to review all the code submitted to the project. Depending on my schedule, this could take some time, so please be patient! 3. CI Requires that you set an Environment Variable. \u00b6 You need your own Reddit account to test RMD locally. Generate a Refresh Code, then set it in the env variable RMD_REFRESH_TOKEN . 4. Document your reasoning behind the changes. \u00b6 This one is pretty obvious, but please make the description of your changes as detailed as is appropriate. 5. If you bring in a new library or change an existing one, document it. \u00b6 For any new or changed links to external libraries, an explanation for why it is required. Additionally, you must provide a link to the lib's home page. However the lib is imported/embeded, you should also include where to find the link used on the lib's documentation. Any PRs requiring undocumented packages or embedding CDN links without explanation will be denied. 6. Any obfuscated code, or code deliberately difficult to read, will be denied. \u00b6 This should go without saying, but if I can't read your code, it's not making it in. Where possible, try to maintain best practices with code style. In most cases, this includes PEP8 for Python. That's about it! Just use common sense and everything will be easy. If you have any questions/concerns, feel free to open an Issue or message ShadowMoose.","title":"Contribution Guidelines"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#contribution-guidelines","text":"All contributions to RMD are welcome!

They allow you to choose from all manner of ways to screen posts - such as Upvotes, Title, Body Text, SFW Warnings, Date Posted, etc. Getting started with Filters \u00b6 Filters can be added/removed from a Source simply, using the WebUI. Filters are simple logic. They require 3 things: A field to check from each post. (Upvotes, Title, Time Posted, etc) A comparator value. (Minimum, Maximum, Equal to, or Regex Match) \"Regex Match\", while more advanced, is very powerful. It allows you to filter by text values in creative ways. The value to compare against. This is whatever you want the limit to be.

Changing Settings \u00b6 Settings can be adjusted within the WebUI, the settings.json file RMD generates, or they can be overridden by passing the setting category and name from the command line, like so: --category.setting_name If a setting has multiple options, its value must be one of its options. To see all the possible settings, check out the Settings List page. Notable Settings \u00b6 There are a few settings that many people will specifically want to change, so they are documented here. Auth \u00b6 This is set using the WebUI, by requesting authorization from Reddit. Interface \u00b6 The settings in this group all control how RMD handles displaying itself. By default, RMD will use a Web-based interface. if you would prefer to use a console-based interface, change these settings. base_dir \u00b6 This is the base directory RMD will save all your files to. For best results, use an absolute path. file_name_pattern \u00b6 This is the pattern RMD will use, within the base directory, to name the downloaded files. It supports folders, and should be relative. This is a pattern , which means it can inject tagged data from each Post into the filename. See File Name Patterns for how to use this feature. manifest \u00b6 This is the path to the database file that RMD creates to track download progress. If this setting is a relative path (starting with \"./\"), it is relative to the download directory. RMD also allows this to be an absolute path (typically something like \"C://\", depending on your system). If you wish to download to a directory on a network/remote drive you must change this to a local path, because RMD requires the ability to exclusively access this file - which most networks will not allow. concurrent_downloads \u00b6 This controls how many concurrent downloads are allowed. Adjust this to control RMD's speed and resource usage. deduplicate_files \u00b6 If enabled, RMD will delete any files - after downloading them - if it discovers a copy of the same file already exists. Additionally, for images, RMD will perform a visual comparison between all images it downloads, and will remove images that are visually the same. This enables RMD to ignore lower-quality, compressed duplicates of the same pictures. On the WebUI Browser side, RMD will remember which images have been deduplicated, and all unique posts will still be searchable. Imgur Settings \u00b6 Imgur is a major media host on Reddit. For direct imgur links, or links to public albums, RMD will work just fine without configuring these settings. Some imgur albums, however, are hidden from the public view. In order to support hidden/private albums or galleries, you'll need to register an imgur application and provide the ID & Secret to RMD. The imgur API has limits. RMD will try as hard as it can to avoid using the API, but it will use the API if it encounters a private album/gallery that it otherwise cannot scrape. Links to single images will not use the API. If you do not want to use the imgur API, and are okay with some albums failing, you can leave these settings blank. To register an imgur Application: Visit https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient while signed in to imgur. On the registration page, the Name/Callback URL/Website/Description can be any values. Check the box for \"Anonymous usage without user authorization\" Fill in a valid email address Click submit, then copy the Client ID & Secret from the following page. File Name Patterns \u00b6 Anywhere File Patterns are used, they allow for data insertion based off the Post being saved. To insert them, include '[tag_name]' in the path. EG: '/custom/[subreddit]/[author]/' Available tags: type (will be 'Post'/'Comment') reddit_id title author subreddit source_alias created_utc (A numeric Unix Timestamp, eg: 1552739416) [created_date] (Formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD') [created_time] (Formatted as 'HH.MM.SS') For example, you could tell RMD to output Posts to subdirectories based off Username by setting the pattern to something like /[author]/[type]/[subreddit]/[created_date] [created_time] - [title] . The above pattern would generate a file path similar to /ShadowMoose/Submission/DataHoarder/2019-10-21 02.20.15 - Test Post.jpg for each file downloaded. Arguments in RMD \u00b6 While it's suggested you make any settings changes with the WebUI, or in the 'settings.json' file generated, you may find yourself instead wanting to pass a few things in for one-off runs (or automation). All arguments are optional: -h, --help - show help message and exit --settings - path to custom Settings file. --run_tests - launch in Test Mode. This will only work in testing environments. --category.setting - See Changing Settings for usage. --list_settings - Print a list of all Settings, their descriptions, and their default values. Exits after printing. --source, -s - Regex pattern. If specified, only sources - loaded from the settings file - with aliases matching a supplied pattern will be checked. This argument can be passed multiple times, to specify multiple patterns. (EX: \"main.py -s filter1 -s filter2 ...etc\") --version, -v - Print the current RMD version, then exit. --authorize, -a - Manually use the in-console authentication method to grant RMD access to Reddit. --limit - See Direct Downloading for this usage. Direct Downloading \u00b6 If you would like to, you can directly download from Users or Subreddits using only the command line, without a configured Source. To do this, simply call RMD with the desired usernames or subreddits - including the u/ or r/ prefixes - separated by spaces. When you use this feature, you may also specify a limit to the amount of Posts to be loaded. Do this by passing the --limit flag. if this is not specified, the default limit is 1000. EG: python redditdownloader /u/theshadowmoose r/funny --limit=500 Calling RMD like this will disable any other preconfigured Sources for this run, and RMD will use the Terminal to display progress.","title":"Settings & Arguments"},{"location":"Advanced_Usage/Settings/#settings-arguments","text":"There are many ways to customize Reddit Media Downloader to your liking, and this page attempts to document them.","title":"Settings &amp; Arguments"},{"location":"Advanced_Usage/Settings/#changing-settings","text":"Settings can be adjusted within the WebUI, the settings.json file RMD generates, or they can be overridden by passing the setting category and name from the command line, like so: --category.setting_name If a setting has multiple options, its value must be one of its options.

We'll briefly cover the basics you'll need to get started here. Starting RMD \u00b6 Once you've installed RMD , you can run RMD at any time by launching Run.py (if you downloaded a release binary, just launch the executable). If you'd prefer to use a terminal, and you're running from the source code, RMD can be started using using the terminal command: python Run.py Note: If there are multiple Python installations on your machine, make sure you're running with python3.

Yes, I know I'm jumping a whole major version again. Before I get into further detail, the major jump is because this release may bring breaking changes to some preexisting users. If you're a previous user with a lot of Posts saved, or you've been running RMD in automated server-side setups, please read the patch notes before updating. See Upgrading at the bottom of this file, before running the upgraded RMD on an old database. SQLite Manifest \u00b6 The manifest (and all other non-setting data) is now stored in a SQLite database. This massively shrinks the memory requirements for users downloading thousands of Posts. Startup speed, as well as overall runtime, will likely be noticably faster for users. File hashes (used for deduplication) are now archived and timestamped. This will prevent files from being re-hashed unless RMD finds one that has been modified since it last checked. Being able to skip checking known files means RMD is massively faster when checking old Posts. File paths are now stored relative to the base download directory. RMD can now be booted from anywhere (provided you tell it where the settings file is) Moving the RMD base storage directory will no longer impact RMD's performance. User Interface (WebUI) \u00b6 RMD now has a User Interface! It's has an awesome media viewer. it's browser-based. It's also enabled by default after converting, so be sure to disable it if you're running on a headless server. Settings (and Command Line Argument) Overhaul \u00b6 Settings have been rebuild from the ground up to provide much-needed features for supporting a UI. Your old settings file will be automatically converted on the first post-update RMD launch. Settings are still stored in settings.json , and most of them are the same. Several new settings have been added, relating the to WebUI. As a result of the Settings changes, there have been several added and removed command-line parameters. Most notably, all parameters relating to things controlled by settings are now passed in a new format. Check the new options here Ding Dong, the Wizard's Dead \u00b6 Because the UI is just so much better at managing Settings, the wizard has been replaced by it. Users running on external servers can either access the UI remotely, or run an RMD instance locally to generate the settings file. New Authentication \u00b6 RMD no longer accepts usernames and passwords for authentication. Instead, it uses oAuth. Big thanks to the PRAW Devs for fixing the oAuth bug previously preventing this This also enables accounts with 2FA to authorize smoothly. More Reddit Options \u00b6 RMD can now sort all applicable Sources by \"best\". Many Sources now optionally accept a list of comma-separated subreddits/users/etc to individually scan. PushShift Support \u00b6 PushShift has been added for scanning Subreddits and Users. The PushShift API allows you to scan beyond the 1000 post limit Reddit's site has, and it's fast! Multiprocessing Support \u00b6 RMD now uses multiple processes, instead of multiple threads. This allows RMD to use multiple CPU cores, and prevents bottlenecking during heavy downloading. Prebuilt Binaries & Automatic updater \u00b6 RMD releases now come with prebuilt binary executables - supporting Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu. If you use one of these binaries, it will (by default) automatically update itself to the latest packages. This auto-update feature makes sure that you're using the latest packages to download the broadest site support. To disable this feature, either use the python version, or launch the binary with --skip_update . Bug Fixes \u00b6 Comments now properly set their own ID, rather than their parent ID. This requires a one-time conversion, which will attempt to prevent RMD from re-downloading those Posts. While most Comments will likely be converted, if you've got an especially large amount of comments already saved, you may notice several end up downloading duplicates. If you're still concerned, see here for more information. Long filenames on non-windows systems should be properly trimmed to OS length constraints. Fixed a possible (but unlikely) race condition where the same Post could be processed twice when the stars aligned. Upgrading \u00b6 Upgrading to this RMD version will require you to first run a conversion utility, which is bundled with RMD. This tool can be launched, using python redditdownloader/tools/manifest_converter.py . You can also directly launch it directly from within its folder. The tool exists to convert old database formats to the new one, as well as fix a few data bugs from older versions. Because of these bugs, not all posts may be correctly migrated to the new format.
